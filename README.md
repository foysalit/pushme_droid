## An minimal and elegant calendar component built for ionic

Please follow [this commit](https://github.com/foysalit/pushme_droid/commit/74aea7e086a931ad700c00b0c5f1d04b66564994) if you'd like to build it on your own or understand how the internals work. 

If you'd like to simply run it on your machine and test it out, run the following commands:

```bash
git clone -b calendar https://github.com/foysalit/pushme_droids.git
cd pushme_droids
npm i
ionic serve
```

Then go to `http://localhost:8100` on your browser to see the results.

***Here's how it looks***
